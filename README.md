This repository is used to test the Deployment process of cloud service extended support with IaC

_Cloud Services (extended support) is Azure Resource Manager based deployment model for Cloud Services (classic) and is currently in public preview.
This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities._
_For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)._

_Cloud Services (extended support) is a new [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) based deployment model for [Azure Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services/) product and is currently in public preview. Cloud Services (extended support) has the primary benefit of providing regional resiliency along with feature parity with Azure Cloud Services deployed using Azure Service Manager. It also offers some ARM capabilities such as role-based access and control (RBAC), tags, policy and supports deployment templates._
